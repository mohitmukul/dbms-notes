 ## What is Data?

 -   Data is a collection of raw , unprocessed, facts which have no meaning.
      ex= any text, number ,etc.


## What is Database?

-  The organised collection of structured data
-  collection of _related data_.
['related data means all the structured data related to particul thing']
- ex= info releted to student [ - Name,
                                - Roll no,
                                - Address,
                                - Age,
                                - Gender
                              ]

## Meta data - [ meta data is like _data about data_
                ex-> you clicked a picture that picture is your data
                  -> and the info about the picture like time,date 
                     when you clicked this is you meta data ]

 
 ## What is DBMS?

 - DBMS stand for _Database Management System_.
 - DBMS is a _Software_ used to manage database file.
 - it helps to manage ,store and retrive data effeciently and in structured format.
 ## operations to handle data
 - Create
 - Read
 - Update
 - Delete

 ## Types of DataBase

 - there are 5 types of database of which two are popular and commonly used
  (relational Database and noSql Database)

 -  | Type               | Description                             | Common Use Cases              |
    |--------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
    | Relational (SQL)   | Structured tables with predefined       |Banking,Business apps,inventory|
    |                    | scheema and relationship                |                               |
                         
    | NoSQL              | Flexible schema,optimized for scalablit | Real-time apps, big data      |
    |                    |  and varied data formats                |                               |

    | Hierarchical       | Tree-like parent-child relationships    | Legacy systems, file systems  |

    | Network            | Graph-like multiple relationships       | Telecom, early DBMS models    |
    
    | Time-Series        | Optimized for timestamped data          | IoT, monitoring, analytics    |




 ## SQL database(relational)

 -  Data is stored in table format(rows and Columns)
 - Each table has fixed Scheema( defiend columns and data types).
 - Uses primary keys to uniquely identify rows and foreign keys to establish relationships between  tables.
 - Support ACID properties for reliable transactions.

 # example
 - MySQL
 - PostgreSQL
 - Oracle
 - Microsoft SQL Server

 # Use Cases:
- When data is highly structured and consistent.
- Applications needing complex queries and joins.
- Systems requiring strong consistency and transactional integrity (e.g., banking, ERP).

🔐 ACID Properties Explained
>Atomicity  |A transaction is all or nothing. If any part fails, the entire transaction is rolled back. 

>Consistency |  Ensures the database moves from one valid state to another. All rules (constraints, triggers) must be preserved.

>Isolation |  Transactions are executed independently. Intermediate states are hidden from other transactions.

>Durability |  Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent—even in case of system crashes.


🧠 Why ACID Matters
- Atomicity prevents partial updates that could corrupt data.
- Consistency ensures business rules are always enforced.
- Isolation avoids conflicts in concurrent transactions.
- Durability guarantees reliability after commit.
These properties are foundational in relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

# NoSQL DBMS

- They are designed to handle large-scale data and provide high performance for scenarios where relational models might be restrictive.

- They store data in various non-relational formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs or columns.

- these flexible data models helps fast scaling and good for unstructured or semistructure data

# Use Case	
- Ideal for big data, real-time web apps, and data lakes.


| Feature        | SQL                        | NoSQL                                             |
|----------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Data structure |table whit rows and columns |document based ,key-value,column-family,graph-based|

| Scheema        |Fixed Scheema predefinded   |flexible scheema(dynamic and adaptable)            | 
                 |structure
|Scalability     | Vertically scalable        |Horizontally scalable(adding more server)          |
                 | (upgrading hardware)       |                                                   |

|Data Integrity	 | ACID -complaint(strong     |BASE-compliant (more available, less consistent)   |
                 |           consistency)     |

|Performance     |Efficient for complex queries| Better for large-scale data and fast read/write
                 |  and transactions          |  operations


# keys in Database
1. Primary Key
- a primary key uniquely identify each record in a table.
- it cannot be null and must have a unique key for every row.
- Each table can have only one primary key, which can be a single column or a combination of    columns.

# ex: CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
    );

2. Foreign key

- foreing key is which create the link between two tables
- It refers to the primary key in another table.
- Used to maintain referential integrity between related data.

## ex :CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
  enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id INT,
  course_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Students(student_id)
);

## 6. Relationships

## 🟩 One-to-One
- Definition: Each record in Table A is linked to exactly one record in Table B, and vice versa.
# Example:
- Users table and UserProfiles table.
- Each user has one profile, and each profile belongs to one user.
# CREATE TABLE Users (
  user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(100)
);

# CREATE TABLE UserProfiles (
  profile_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT UNIQUE,
  bio TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);



## 🟨 One-to-Many
- Definition: One record in Table A can be linked to many records in Table B.
#  Example:
- Authors table and Books table.
- One author can write many books, but each book has one author.
# CREATE TABLE Authors (
  author_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100)
);

# CREATE TABLE Books (
  book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(100),
  author_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES Authors(author_id)
);



## 🟥 Many-to-Many
- Definition: Records in Table A can be linked to multiple records in Table B, and vice versa.
#  Example:
- Students table and Courses table.
- A student can enroll in many courses, and each course can have many students.
- Requires a junction table (e.g., Enrollments).
# CREATE TABLE Students (
  student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100)
);

# CREATE TABLE Courses (
  course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(100)
);

# CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
  student_id INT,
  course_id INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Students(student_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES Courses(course_id)
);
