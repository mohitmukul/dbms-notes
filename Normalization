# Database Normalization - Complete Guide

## Why Normalize?

- Normalazation is a method used to breaking down of large complex tabels into smaller related tables and define relationship between them.
. it redeuse redendency(duplicate) of data in table and also remove inconsistency problem and unwanted risk.

- **advantages**
- maintain data integrity(primary key ,unique key).
- reduce the large complex structure of table.
- avoid null value.
- structuring of data so that model is flexible and easy to use.

## types of Normalization
- 1NF
- 2NF
- 3NF
- BCNF 
- 4NF
- 5NF

## 1NF
-  Data should be stored in a table with rows and column and every coulumn should contain indiviual values.

**example**

StudentID | Name   | Courses
__________|________|_________________
1         | Alice  | Math, Physics
2         | Bob    | Chemistry

**1NF conversion**

--every column should have individual/uniqe value

StudentID | Name   | Course
__________|________|__________
1         | Alice  | Math
1         | Alice  | Physics
2         | Bob    | Chemistry



 **2NF (Second Normal Form)**

1NF Table (with partial dependency):

((here instruction only depend on the Course(composite key)))

StudentID | Name |Course   | Instructor
__________|______|_________|____________
1         |ankint|Math     | Prof. A
1         |amohti| Physics  | Prof. B


## 2NF Tables (table must be in 1NF -(means-column should have unique value)):

- all nun key attribute should be fully dependent on the primary key (no partial dependencies)-(non-prime attribute depends on full primary key).

## 2nf table (here we created 2 table )
(one with primary key attribute containing unique value )

StudentID | name
__________|__________
1         | ankint
1         | amohit


(and one with all the nun key attribut(duplicate value)
created a column of foreign key(with refrence of primary key) to create realtion with table one.)

StudentID|Course   | Instructor
_________|_________|____________
1        |Math     | Prof. A
1        |Physics  | Prof. B


**3NF (Must be in - 2NF )**

- No transistive dependency( non-key attribut should not depend on other non-key attributes).

Table1:Student

StudentID|Course   | Instructor
_________|_________|____________
1        |Math     | Prof. A
1        |Physics  | Prof. B


(- here (Course)is depend on StudentID but which is correct 
-but
 - (Instructor) is depend on (Course) which is incorrect - because Course is a non key).

 After 3NF:

Table: Course
StudentID | Course
__________|__________
1         | Maths
1         | Physics

Table: instructor
StudentID| Instructor
_________|____________
1        | Prof. A
1        | Prof. B


🧠 Interview Q&A
## Q: Why normalize?
A: Remove redundancy, prevent anomalies, save space
## Q: What is denormalization?
A: Intentionally adding redundancy for performance (e.g., fewer joins)
