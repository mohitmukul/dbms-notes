# Database Normalization - Complete Guide

## Why Normalize?

- Normalazation is a method used to breaking down of large complex tabels into smaller related tables and define relationship between them.
. it redeuse redendency(duplicate) of data in table and also remove inconsistency problem and unwanted risk.

- **advantages**
- maintain data integrity(primary key ,unique key).
- reduce the large complex structure of table.
- avoid null value.
- structuring of data so that model is flexible and easy to use.

## types of Normalization
- 1NF
- 2NF
- 3NF
- BCNF 
- 4NF
- 5NF

## 1NF
-  Data should be stored in a table with rows and column and every coulumn should contain indiviual values.

**example**

StudentID | Name   | Courses
__________|________|_________________
1         | Alice  | Math, Physics
2         | Bob    | Chemistry

**1NF conversion**

--every column should have uniqe value

StudentID | Name   | Course
__________|________|__________
1         | Alice  | Math
1         | Alice  | Physics
2         | Bob    | Chemistry

 2NF (Second Normal Form)
1NF Table (with partial dependency):

## 2NF Tables (table must be in 1NF -(means-column should have unique value)):

- all nun key attribute should be fully dependent on the primary key (no partial dependencies)-(non-prime attribute depends on full primary key).
